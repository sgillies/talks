                Geospatial data processing. Good data is essential. Good data
                requires a lot of hard work.

                At Mapbox, I get to write software to make data processing
                easier, more fault tolerant, more predictable, more scalable.
                Fun, even. That's what I aspire to.

                The Python programming language is a big part of data 
                processing at Mapbox. I'm going to talk this morning about
                Python's role in GIS, lessons I'm learning about using it,

            In a reply, Norman Vine pointed out that the UMN MapServer

            In 2000, this would have been Python version 1.5.2.

            I was an ArcView user in 2000, but didn't find out about 
            AVPython until 2002, after I'd moved on from my job at the

            Python isn't the cool or cutting edge language where I work. Not by a long
            shot. We use it at Mapbox because it has more features or more maturity
            in some important domains. You might be in the same boat as me.

            Python's scientific, engineering, and mathematics software ecosystem is
            exceptional. The Numpy, Scipy, and Scikit projects are heavy lifters with
            no mature equivalents in Node.js.

            For us in this room, it's also significant that Python is the primary
            scripting language for Esri's ArcGIS and also QGIS.

            Python still matters. It's a great general purpose language and is
            very strong in the rapidly growing data science field. It remains
            a very useful language for GIS.

            It's never to early to start testing your code. The longer you
            wait to start testing, the harder it is to write the tests. Start
            while it's easy.

            There are a number of ways to test Python code. The good ones 
            make it easy to get started. I like "pytest".

            <aside class="notes">

            For pytest, you write functions that start with "test" and make
            assertions. No xUnit boilerplate. Your first tests are as simple
            as that. As I'm showing here, you can even put the tests inside
            your script, although we usually keep the tests outside in 
            another module as they grow.

            Pytest works by modifying the abstract syntax tree of your
            module in a process its author calls "assertion introspection."
            
            Instead of an AssertionError, you get a comparison of the

            I rely on Python's multiprocessing module to parallelize data
            processing work and use all my computer's CPUs.

            Why not threading? Because Python's global interpreter lock
            ensures that only one thread in a process is running at a time.
            This means that threading is only useful for asynchronous I/O
            in Python.

            Multiprocessing can be very effective in processing raster data.
            I'm going to use as an example, the problem of turning a raster
            dataset in some projection into a set of web mercator (a different
            projection) tiles of many zoom levels.

            The example above comes from the Python docs. For my problem,
            what I pass to the pool's map() is descriptors of all my 
            mercator tiles and a function that, given, a tile descriptor,
            makes an destination raster - warps the source dataset into it -
            and returns that raster tile as a sequence of bytes.

                managing dependencies becomes a little more difficult.

                How do we stay out of requirement hell as we deploy and run

            Virtualenv is a Python command. It creates "virtual environments":
            a Python executable and its own private non-standard modules,
            or what we call "site packages". I like to use virtualenv in a 
            way that reminds my colleagues of Node.js's node_modules directory.
            Because they are largely Node users.

            This is more or less the equivalent of what "npm install" does

            <ul>
                <li>Faster installation for pure python and native C extension packages.</li>
                <li>Avoids arbitrary code execution for installation.</li>
                <li>Installation of a C extension does not require a compiler on Windows or OS X.</li>

            If you're building a pluggable Python program, such as pytest, 
            which I mentioned earlier, consider using Python's own plugin
            system instead of rolling your own.

            The code above is from the setup script of pytest's own coverage
            plugin.

            Pytest queries its Python for registered entry points to discover
            such plugins at run time.

            <aside class="notes">
            
            We're using this same plugin system to make Rasterio's command
            line interface better organized and pluggable in a way that
            GDAL's utility suite (gdal_translate and friends) is not.

            If you look closely, you can see that we've added a little bit
            of emoji assistance to let you know if a third party plugin is
            broken.
