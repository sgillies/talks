            <h1>RFC 7946: the GeoJSON format</h1>

            <aside class="notes">
            RFC 7946 was published in August 2016 after 8 months as an
            adopted draft (draft-ietf-geojson) and 17 months as an independent
            draft (draft-butler-geojson).

            An "RFC" is what the IETF calls a "Request for Comments" and 
            contain technical and organizational notes about the internet.
            This one is number 7946.

            RFC 1: Host Software was written by Steve Crocker at UCLA on April
            7, 1969. Interestingly, a problem described in RFC 1 is that of
            preserving console responsiveness between network hosts (you
            accessing utilities of host B while typing on a terminal of host A)
            and it proposes that host B would deliver a front end program for
            the utility to host A, so that, for example, information could be
            input and parsed as though the program were running on A. You can
            see the origins of Code on demand, Java applets, ActionScript,
            JavaScript in RFC 1.

            7944: Diameter Routing Message Priority is the RFC preceding.
            Diameter is an authentication, authorization, and accounting
            protocol for computer networks and plays a role in mobile roaming.

            7949: OSPFv3 over IPv4 for IPv6 Transition.
            </aside>

            <p class="fragment">The spec at geojson.org is obsolete</p>
            
            <aside class="notes">
            RFC 7946 replaces the specification published in 2008 at geojson.org.
            It is the definition of the GeoJSON format for the internet.
            
            I'm here to persuade you to adopt and reference 7946 in your
            projects.

            <h1>RFC 7946 is better</h1>

            <li class="fragment">Bug fixes</li>
            <li class="fragment">Constraints</li>

            <li class="fragment">It's an internet standard</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
            The spec is technically better. We fixed actual errors in text
            and examples. We clarified ambiguities.

            We've added constraints. Constraints are a good thing for
            interoperability.

            Clear IPR. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3979.

            Clear direction for the future. GeoJSON now belongs to the
            internet and there is a process for documenting
            errata and even obsoleting it that the ad hoc GeoJSON working
            group did not provide before.

            The IETF's GeoJSON WG remains open for discussions about the
            format and implementation.

            <p>6 or 7 decimal places is enough for long, lat</p>

            <aside class="notes">
            This is something we all know we should do, but often do little
            about. It's now a recommendation in the RFC. Think of the polar
            bears before you write longitude and latitude to 15 decimal places.

            <p class="fragment">Have no special semantics</p>

            <aside class="notes">
               GeometryCollections have a different syntax from single type Geometry
   objects but have no different semantics.  Although a
   GeometryCollection object has no "coordinates" member, it does have
   coordinates: the coordinates of all its parts belong to the
   collection.  The "geometries" member of a GeometryCollection
   describes the parts of this composition.  Implementations SHOULD NOT
   apply any additional semantics to the "geometries" array.

            <aside class="notes">
            The original spec was not clear about this. WG consensus is
            that great circles would be a change and not a necessary one:
            representation of great circles in GeoJSON by approximation
            is not a blocker for applications.

            <p>Implementations SHOULD NOT extend position arrays beyond 3
            elements</p>

            <aside class="notes">
            Previously, the spec said that the meaning of extra elements was
            undefined. WG consensus is that extra elements are bad for
            interoperability. How does a consumer know what a 4th or 5th
            element means? It's better to put such extension data in JSON
            objects.  </aside>

            <aside class="notes">
            Away from the antimerdian and poles, this is the same as before.
            What's new is that boxes that cross the antimeridian and touch the
            poles can now be unambiguously specified.  </aside>

            <p class="fragment">Math and Physics right-hand rule</p>

            <aside class="notes">
            This is more to help with interoperability with other standards and
            systems than to distinguish positive and negative areas within
            GeoJSON. This distinction is already covered by the requirement

            <h2>Foreign members</h2>
            <p>#Clarification</p>
            <p>Parsers MAY ignore them</p>
            <p class="fragment">Members of foreign members are also foreign</p>

            <aside class="notes">
            Any object or member not defined in RFC 7946 is a foreign
            object, meaning that their semantics are undefined in GeoJSON
            and must be specified elsewhere. If you request data in
            "application/geo+json" format and receive GeoJSON with
            foreign members, you MAY ignore them.

            The spec know acknowledges that extension of
            GeoJSON is possible and that people do it, but doesn't
            specify how extensions are discovered or used.</aside>

            <h2>Example</h2>

            <pre><code class="json">
{ "type": "Feature",
  "centerline": {
    "type": "LineString",
    "coordinates": [[-10, 10], [10, 10]] } }
            </code></pre>

            <p>RFC 7946 defines no meaning of "centerline"</p>
            <p class="fragment">"type: LineString" also has no meaning</p>

            <aside class="notes">
            "centerline" is a foreign member of the Feature object. Even 
            though its value looks like a Geometry object, it is not a 
            geometry of the Feature. GeoJSON parsers may ignore the 
            centerline object. It's up to GeoJSON extensions to define
            what the meaning of this "centerline" is.</aside>

            <h2>Be Generous</h2>
            <p>Help make extensions possible</p>
            <p>GDAL 2.1 preserves foreign members between GeoJSON files</p>

            <aside class="notes">
            Foreign members MAY be ignored but that doesn't mean that you
            SHOULD discard them automatically. GeoJSON tools that are JSON
            tools at heart can be generous and keep foreign members that
            might include extensions. In GDAL 2.1, ogr2ogr will preserve
            foreign members when both the input and output are GeoJSON.</aside>

            <p>"urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC::CRS84" is it</p>

            <aside class="notes">
            I'm saving the best for last!

            Coordinate reference systems are no longer in the core of the
            specification; use CRS84 longitude and latitude with GeoJSON from
            now on.  </aside>

        <section>
            <h1>Why?</h1>
            <p class="fragment">geojson.org named CRS was poorly done</p>
            <p class="fragment">Linked CRS is potentially harmful</p>
            <p class="fragment">Agreeing on a single, if imperfect CRS, keeps simple
            applications uncomplicated</p>

            <aside class="notes">
            In hindsight, the obviously right way to specify a CRS by its
            identifier or name is to use a single JSON item, {crs: name}.

            Linked CRS: do you understand how this was supposed to work?
            You could specify a URL for a resource describing (not identifying)
            the CRS to be applied to a GeoJSON object.
            
            Say you have a service that accepts GeoJSON uploads and someone
            uploads GeoJSON with a linked CRS. Your parser would make an
            HTTP request for the resource â€“ and because the geojson.org spec
            didn't define these resources this doesn't work in practice,
            but ignore this for now â€“ which is a bit of a drag, network 
            requests being much more slow than parsing GeoJSON in memory.
            But it's only one request, right?

            Well, the geojson.org spec says you can have a "crs" on any
            object. Say someone uploads a 1000 feature collection with a 
            linked crs on each feature. That's 1000 requests to make. 

            A GeoJSON file like this is trivial to create and expensive to
            process. Do you recognize the problem here? Implementing linked
            CRS makes your system vulnerable to attack.

            Finally, agreeing on a single CRS keeps simple applications
            simple.

            If you want to use projected GeoJSON, producers and consumers
            need to have an agreement and understanding, and anything you
            can come up with is probably better than named or linked CRS.
